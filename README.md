# Mindmap-Anatomy-Category-Game
A project that aims to combine the ABC category game concept with a mindmap anatomy of any single person, with 8 other bots representing friends/families around that 
main person. This is a web-based app that is written in HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. The concept of the game is based on the ABC category game, where a random category
and a random letter is generated, and the user has to type in an example of said category that starts with the letter that was generated before the last bot. There are 5
difficulty levels in this game, in which the speed of the bot answers increases per difficulty level. 

Potential idea expansion: Increase more categories, a spell-checker to see if the word inputted by the user is a real word, and maybe a neural network that can do some Natural Language Processing and automate bot answers from the internet, instead of creating fixed answers for the bot to choose from.
